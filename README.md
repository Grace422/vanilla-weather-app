# Weather App - SheCodes Project

This project is a simple **Weather App** created as part of my learning journey with [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/). The application allows users to search for any city and retrieve real-time weather information, including the current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and the present date.

## Features

### 1. **Search for Any City**
- Users can input the name of a city in the search bar and retrieve:
  - **Temperature**: The current temperature of the searched city.
  - **Weather Conditions**: Description of the weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
  - **Humidity**: The percentage of humidity in the air.
  - **Wind Speed**: The wind's speed in the city.
  - **Current Date**: The present date displayed in a user-friendly format.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the app's content.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and ensuring a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching and displaying weather data dynamically using APIs.
